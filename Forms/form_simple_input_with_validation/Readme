this is a GENERIC PURPOSE form 
--------------------------------

Form
    - can have few Input all configured in an array as props
    - iterate arInputLogic to elegantly create the form

Form Props
    arInputLogic : array of InputLogic each for Input element
    isFormValid : function which return true if form is valid and false otherwise
    handleSubmit : function which is invoked when submit button is clicked (provided disabled is false)

Input
    Input is a component which has two html elements :
        - input (it apply to text , password and also submit) or textarea or select
        - label


All styling is done inline in Input.js because i do not use css module


Input Props 
    - inputType : input , textarea , select
    - labelText : this is the text of the html label element
    - htmlInputAttributes : these are the attributes of the html input element which give 
                           a lot of flexibility. e.g. type can be used  
    - inputChangeHandler : html input change handler , has upper level state which has the
                           input value     
    - validationErrorHandler : function which return validation error for this input
    - isFormValid : function which return is form valid        
    - content : extra info used currently only for select :  array holding list of options                                           


Limitation 
    - i have tested it also with type 'checkbox' and it is not working because evt.target.value does not fit.
      In this case evt.target.value.checked might fit but it requires some small code change which is possible 
      because type is known


Validation 
    - each Input component (beside submit button) has an html p element which is used for validation error
    - the submit button is disabled until the form is valid (via props.isFormValid of Form)
    - the submit button change is color according to the value of isFormValid


Todo
    - handle not working input type - checkbox
